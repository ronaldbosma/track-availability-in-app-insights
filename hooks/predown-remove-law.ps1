  This PowerShell script is executed before the resources are removed.
  It permanently deletes all Log Analytics workspaces in the resource group to prevent issues with future deployments.
  Sometimes the requests and traces don't show up in Application Insights & Log Analytics when removing and deploying the template multiple times.
  A predown hook is used and not a postdown hook because permanent deletion of the workspace doesn't work
  if it's already in the soft-deleted state after azd has removed it.
